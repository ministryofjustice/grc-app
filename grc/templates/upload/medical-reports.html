                You need 2 reports written by 2 different doctors or clinical psychologists registered in the UK.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                The reports both need to include the name, practice address and contact details of the person who wrote the report.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">
                At least 1 of the 2 reports needs to include details of any gender affirmation treatment
                you’ve had or plan to have, including:
            </p>
            <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>any surgical treatments</li>
                <li>any non-surgical treatments, such as hormone therapy</li>

            </ol>
            <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">
                The first report needs to confirm your gender dysphoria diagnosis and the clinical history this was based on, including:

                <li>who made the diagnosis</li>

                This first report needs to be written by a registered doctor or clinical psychologist who
                practises in the field of gender dysphoria. You can find one of these by:
            </p>
            <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>asking your GP for a referral</li>

                The second report can be written by any registered doctor or clinical psychologist,
                including your GP, a surgeon or an endocrinologist.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                There’s no required content for this second report, and it can include the same information from the first report.

                The reports do not need to be specially written for your application, so long as they meet all the requirements.
                You may already have suitable reports in your medical records.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                If you do need new reports written, you’ll probably need to pay for them even if you use NHS medical practitioners.
