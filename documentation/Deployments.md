# Deployments

We use [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for our deployments.  
Here are the [GitHub Actions pipelines for the GRC service](https://github.com/cabinetoffice/grc-app/actions).

## TODO
Add details of how each deployment work
(e.g. pushing to X branch deploys to Y environment and does Z other thing)
