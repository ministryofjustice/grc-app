^ You can [order a birth, death, marriage or civil partnership certificate online](https://www.gov.uk/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate) if you live in England and Wales. There’s a different process for [getting certificates in Scotland](http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/registration/how-to-order-an-official-extract-from-the-registers) and [Northern Ireland](http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/do-it-online/government-citizens-and-rights-online/order-a-birth-adoption-death-marriage-or-civil-partnership-certificate.htm).

Your application will then be reviewed by the Gender Recognition Panel. You will be contacted if they need more information.

You will then be told if you will be issued with a Gender Recognition Certificate, and what you can do if your application has not been accepted.

The panel will usually look at your application within 30 weeks of applying.

^ If we need to contact you by post in the next 6 months, please let us know if there are any dates we should avoid (for example, if you are away on holiday).
