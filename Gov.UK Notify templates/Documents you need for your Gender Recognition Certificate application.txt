Thank you for checking which documents you need for your Gender Recognition Certificate application.

Based on your answers, these are the documents you need for your application.

Some documents will be uploaded during the application process, while others need to be posted to us after you submit an application.


((need_to_send_name_change_documents??# Copies of all change of name documents))

((need_to_send_name_change_documents??If you’ve changed your name to reflect your affirmed gender, upload copies of all documents that show when you’ve done this.

This includes enrolled or unenrolled deed polls and statutory declarations of name changes. These copies do not need to be certified.))


((need_to_send_medical_reports??# Medical reports))

((need_to_send_medical_reports??You need to upload 2 reports written by 2 different doctors or clinical psychologists registered in the UK.

The reports both need to include the name, practice address and contact details of the person who wrote the report.

At least one of the two reports needs to include details of any gender affirmation treatment you’ve had or plan to have, including:
* any surgical treatments
* any non-surgical treatments, such as hormone therapy
* if you’ve not had any treatment and do not plan to have any, why that’s the case

The first report needs to confirm your gender dysphoria diagnosis and the clinical history this was based on, including:
* who made the diagnosis
* when the diagnosis was made
* what evidence was used to make the diagnosis

This first report needs to be written by a registered doctor or clinical psychologist who practises in the field of gender dysphoria. You can find one of these by:

* asking your GP
* contacting someone on the list of specialists in the field of gender dysphoria

See the following link for a list of specialists in the field of gender dysphoria:
https://draft-origin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/publications/gender-dysphoria-list-of-specialists-t493
Note: this is not a complete list and it’s not always up-to-date

The second report can be written by any registered doctor or clinical psychologist, including your GP, a surgeon or an endocrinologist.

There’s no required content for this second report, and it can include the same information from the first report.

The reports do not need to be specially written for your application, so long as they meet all the requirements. You may already have suitable reports in your medical records.

If you do need new reports written, you’ll probably need to pay for them even if you use NHS medical practitioners.

There is a form that medical practitioners can use to write either of these reports. See the following link for this form:
https://draft-origin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/publications/form-t452-guidelines-for-registered-medical-practitioners-and-registered-psychologists-to-facilitate-completion-of-the-medical-report-proforma-for-g))


((need_to_send_evidence_of_living_in_gender??# Evidence of living in your affirmed gender for 2 years))

((need_to_send_evidence_of_living_in_gender??Upload copies of evidence to show that you’ve been living in your affirmed gender for the last 2 years.

Each piece of evidence should contain at least one of the following that matches up with your affirmed gender:
* a name
* a title, like ‘Mr’ or ‘Miss’
* a gender marker, like ‘male’ or ‘female’

There are no other specific requirements for this evidence, but try to find:
* evidence from different points over the 2 years, with roughly 4 pieces of evidence from each year
* at least one piece of recent evidence
* evidence from a variety of different sources

The evidence can come from before you were diagnosed with gender dysphoria.

Examples of what you can submit include good quality photocopies or photographs of:
* your driving licence
* your passport
* identity cards, like workplace IDs, railcards, health insurance cards, library cards or supermarket loyalty cards
* letters from solicitors, accountants, doctors, dentists or employers
* bank statements
* payslips, P60s and P45s
* benefit letters
* tax letters and documents, including council tax
* utility bills, such as internet bills
* rental agreements
* academic certificates and documents

You might be asked to send in more evidence after you submit your application.))
